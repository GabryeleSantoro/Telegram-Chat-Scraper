# Telegram-Chat-Scraper
This tool allows to scrape through all messages send in a chat or in a channel on Telegram, regardless the chat is set to private.

## How to use
To start using this tool you must change the variables into config.py. All the fields are required to work, except the sendmessage part, that is not mandatory.

To get your api_id and api_hash you have to log in in this website https://my.telegram.org/auth, that will give all the api key to use.
Filled all the fields go to the folder where the files are located and run ``` main.py ```. Then follow the instruction et voil√†, you are officially scraping a telegram chat.

### Responsability
I don't get any responsability for what this tool is used for. I assume is used for legal stuff.
